                        <p>
                          Every day millions of contents are posted online in
                          different forms of posts like blog articles, e-books,
                          whitepapers, slide shows, infographics and videos.
                          People are overloaded with information when it comes
                          to the matter of buying a product or service. Just
                          imagine how much information gets published each day
                          from millions of internet marketers, and how they are
                          struggling to get leads for business. Your content may
                          easily get lost in the jungle of contents and it is
                          even harder to be noticed by your targeted customers.
                          What is the best way to stand out in the crowd?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Visualized data can be the best answer for an
                          effective content marketing campaign and attract
                          people easily. Visualized content like images or
                          infographics has great power to grab attention,
                          increase reader engagement and let them share the
                          content in their network. Here is the fact what makes
                          images and infographics important in online marketing.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        1. Makes a Post Appealing
                        <br />
                        Visual contents like infographic are more appealing to
                        readers than a text post. Colors play an important role
                        in visual content marketing. For instance, research
                        showed a yellow-colored Call-to-Action button result
                        14.5% more conversion than a green-colored button.
                        Variations of color help people absorbing information
                        easily.
                        <br />
                        What is more, human brain loves facts, figures,
                        statistics and other graphical elements. If an
                        infographics is presented in compelling way with
                        well-written texts, it captures visitors’ attention
                        easily. Another study reveals 90% of information that
                        comes to the brain is visual.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        2. Awakens Visitor’s Interest
                        <br />
                        A well-designed infographics has power to fascinate
                        everyone and it makes people to read it. Even a less
                        interested person of the field will go through the
                        information at least once because of its presentation
                        style.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        3. Boosts Traffic
                        <br />
                        Infographics make complex date easier to understand, and
                        turn boring information and eye-staining texts into
                        visually enticing graphic. Such piece of content people
                        enjoys reading and shares on their social media network.
                        In this way, infographics get more visitors than a
                        simple text-only blog post.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        4. Increases Reader Engagement
                        <br />
                        Use of image in a blog post spices up the content and it
                        persuades a reader to explore other pages of the site.
                        The readers like to take more actions in the site like
                        subscribe, bookmark or leave comment.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        5. Boosts SEO
                        <br />
                        Images directly and indirectly works in boosting SEO.
                        Use of relevant image, with proper image optimization,
                        improves search engine ranking. Because of its increased
                        reader engagement, overall bounce rate of the site
                        reduces. The site turns into authority site eventually.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        6. Easily Remembered
                        <br />
                        Images help readers to remember the site for next visit.
                        In addition, an infographics contains business logo,
                        website address, e-mail and contact information. In this
                        way, your business name imprints in your readers mind.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        7. Boost Business Credibility
                        <br />
                        An infographics makes you expert to your visitor on the
                        particular niche. It increases credibility of your brand
                        and product. Even when an image embedded post is shared,
                        it gets more clicks than an ordinary text content.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        8. Offline Promotion
                        <br />
                        Image or infographics content are not limited to
                        internet to spread around. Because of its attractive
                        look, people like to adhere it on wall or share offline.
                        You just need to put your website address in the
                        infographics. Your business will be promoted offline
                        also.
                        <br />
                        A post goes viral when it is created with proper image
                        or developed in infographic form. However, it is
                        essential to ensure that your infographics are designed
                        in right way with sufficient information. Texts should
                        be concise, as you need to put information and graphical
                        matters together in a single page.
